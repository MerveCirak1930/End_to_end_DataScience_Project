# End_to_End_Data_Science_Project

## 1) Problem Overview
Medical Cost Analysis:
The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on the given variables.

## 2) Collecting of data
In this project, I used the Medical Cost Personal Datasets at the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).
### Importing the required libraries
### Loading data set

## 3) Examination and visualization of data
### Exploratory data analysis
### Visualize the data

## 4) Fitting Data to Machine Learning Models
### Data Preprocessing
#### Dealing With Categorical Attributes
1-Label Encoding (0-1)
2-One Hot Encoder
### Features and Labels
### Feature Scaling
* Normalization (also called min-max scaling) 
* Standardization 
### Split the data

## 5)  Model Selection - Creating and Training of the Models
### Model Creation
### Calculating the cross validation scores of models
### Model Selection according to Regression Evaluation Metrics
>> GradientBoostingRegressor has the lowest RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). Therefore, we will continue with that.

## 6) Hyper-parameter Optimization with Grid Search

## 7) Prediction

## 8) Evaluation of the optimized model using regression model evaluation criteria: R2, MAE, MSE

## 9)Finding the Confidence Interval Of %95

### Note:Source code is in master branch of the project
